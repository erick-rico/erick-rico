## Hi there 👋

I'm **Erick Rico Esparza**, an environmental engineer with a background in civil engineering and a growing specialization in **atmospheric and air-quality data analysis**.

I hold a BSc in Civil Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and I am currently completing an **MSc in Environmental Engineering at Tampere University (Finland)**. During my graduate studies, my interests gradually shifted from general environmental engineering toward **atmospheric sciences, synoptic meteorology, and air-pollution dynamics**, driven by hands-on research and data analysis.

As part of my MSc, I completed a **postgraduate exchange at City University of Hong Kong**, where I carried out a **research project in meteorological and environmental data analysis under the supervision of Prof. Jung-Eun Chu**. Through this project, I worked extensively with **reanalysis data, circulation patterns, and composite analysis** to study air-pollution variability, which strongly shaped my current research direction and long-term academic interests.

Building on that experience, I am now working on my **Master’s thesis**, supervised externally by **Prof. Jung-Eun Chu**, internally by **Miikka (Tampere University)**, and with academic guidance from the **Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate Change (ICAyCC, UNAM)**. My thesis focuses on the **synoptic and sub-seasonal circulation patterns associated with extreme PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ pollution episodes over the Valley of Mexico, and their modulation by ENSO**, combining air-quality observations with large-scale atmospheric diagnostics.

I am particularly interested in **reanalysis-based studies**, **circulation regime classification**, and **composite analysis** at multiple time scales. I am continuously improving my workflow for handling **NetCDF data**, working with large atmospheric datasets, and producing physically interpretable and reproducible analyses using **Python** and open-source tools such as **xarray**, **cartopy**, **metpy**, **pandas**, and **numpy**.

I enjoy exploring how **large-scale circulation, boundary-layer processes, and climate variability** interact to shape air-pollution extremes. My goal is to contribute to research that strengthens the physical understanding of pollution episodes and supports evidence-based environmental and climate studies.

In addition to Python, I have experience with **R**, **Julia**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, which I use as complementary tools depending on the analysis needs.

Feel free to explore my repositories — they document my research work, coursework, and ongoing learning in **atmospheric and environmental data science**.

If you would like to know more about my academic background, coursework, or research experience, feel free to contact me. I would be happy to share my **academic CV** and/or connect via **LinkedIn**.

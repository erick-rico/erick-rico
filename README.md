## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Erick Rico Esparza**, a civil engineer turned environmental data enthusiast.

After studying Civil Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and working in construction, I pursued a Master's in Environmental Engineering at Tampere University in Finland. There, I discovered my passion for programming, data analysis, and GIS applied to environmental challenges.

Currently, I'm studying my third semester at City University of Hong Kong as an exchange student, where Iâ€™m taking specialized courses â€” such as Introduction to ENergy and Environmental Data Analysis, Climate Change and Extreme Weather and a research project on Meteorological Data Analysis under Prof. Jung-Eun CHU guidance â€” to eventually work on a thesis focused on environmental data science. In the past few months, Iâ€™ve strengthened my foundations through self-study and hands-on practice with Python, climate data, and spatial analysis, especially, exploring tools and libraries like **xarray**, **cartopy**, **metpy**, and working through resources such as *Think Stats*, *Think Python*, *Python for Data Analysis*, and *100 Days of Code*.

I enjoy working with Python, spatial data, and open datasets to explore and understand environmental phenomena. My goal is to contribute to sustainable solutions through data-driven insights.

While my main focus is Python, I also have some experience with tools like **R**, **Julia**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, which I will use to complement my data analysis workflows in my future projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories â€” they reflect my learning journey and growing expertise in environmental data analysis.

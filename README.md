## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Erick Rico Esparza**, a civil engineer turned environmental data enthusiast.

After studying Civil Engineering at UNAM and working in construction, I pursued a Master's in Environmental Engineering at Tampere University in Finland. There, I discovered my passion for programming, data analysis, and GIS applied to environmental challenges.

Currently, I'm preparing for my third semester at City University of Hong Kong, where Iâ€™ll be taking specialized courses to eventually work on a thesis focused on environmental data science. In the meantime, Iâ€™m strengthening my foundations through self-study and hands-on practice with Python, climate data, and spatial analysis, especially, exploring tools and libraries like **xarray**, **cartopy**, **metpy**, and working through resources such as *Think Stats*, *Think Python*, *Python for Data Analysis*, and *100 Days of Code*.

I enjoy working with Python, spatial data, and open datasets to explore and understand environmental phenomena. My goal is to contribute to sustainable solutions through data-driven insights.

While my main focus is Python, I also have some experience with tools like **R**, **Julia**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, which I will use to complement my data analysis workflows in my future projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories â€” they reflect my learning journey and growing expertise in environmental data analysis.
